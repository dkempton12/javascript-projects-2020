This app modifies text that is typed into the textarea element, depending on which input is selected. 


You can also toggle text between the three different filters.


Several ES6 array methods are used in this app. Including: **map**, **find** and **Array.from**.


The **Math.random method** is also used to generate the number of dots between words in the random spaces filter.
